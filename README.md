## My process

- First, add html tags with class names.
- Use Adobe Illustrator to calculate dimensions.
- Code mobile design first.
- Create the desktop version next using a media query to invoke the desktop css.
- Reviewed final versions - checked style guide and design images to ensure accuracy.
- Update GitHub with changes and published to GitHub pages.
- Write README.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I continued to work on using BEM methodology for my CSS and also used CSS to swap images based on screen size. I learned that there is (for me at least) a specific way to work through the css. Get fonts, font sizes, and line heights correct first. Then work on horizontal margins, then work from top down on vertical margins. I also learned how to add a media query with two conditions.

### Continued development

Work on BEM.
Work deliberately through the css styling. (Don't rush!)
